# TRAUST PROJECT
This project has been created for the Hackathon UTC 2017.

Traust aims to help drivers gain trust in semi-autonomous cars so they can *actually* let go of the steering wheel. 

The code available on this repo is the mobile app (with mock data) that keeps track of your drives (distance, incidents...)
