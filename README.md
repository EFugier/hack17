# TRAUST PROJECT
This project has been created for the Hackathon UTC 2017.

Traust aims at helping drivers to build trust with semi-autonomous cars so that they would *actually* let go the steering wheel and let the vehicule drive itself. The main idea is to let the driver know whenever the car detects a threat through a subtle vibration of the steering wheel and a ride recap.

The code available on this repo is the mobile app (with mock data) that keeps track of your drives (distance, incidents...)
